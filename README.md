# Setup

By default, this workflow will look in the ~/Sites directory for projects. You can can change this with the workflow's projPath environment variable.

You can easily modify this workflow to use another IDE of your choice by simply changing the ideAppName environment variable (e.g. VSCode) but with latest modfication I can not guarantee it will work with VSCode.

# Usage

To use, simply type the "php" shortcut in Alfred,

You will see all project in a given directory.

Select project and open it.
